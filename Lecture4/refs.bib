                  density estimation (KDE) and recent advances regarding
                  confidence bands and geometric/topological features. We begin
                  with a discussion of basic properties of KDE: the convergence
                  rate under various metrics, density derivative estimation,
                  and bandwidth selection. Then, we introduce common approaches
                  to the construction of confidence intervals/bands, and we
                  discuss how to handle bias. Next, we talk about recent
                  advances in the inference of geometric and topological
                  features of a density function using KDE. Finally, we
                  illustrate how one can use KDE to estimate a cumulative
                  distribution function and a receiver operating characteristic
                  curve. We provide R implementations related to this tutorial
                  at the end.",
